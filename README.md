# Snake - Dinosaur Collection
Game of Snake developed during Highschool's summer break in 2015. At that time i was quite proud of this project because i had never tried to build a game and a highscore system. In addition, i only learnt C++ a few months before summer so everything was quite new and exciting. I remember having a lot of fun trying to figure out how to move the snake, implementing the highscore system etc. For real, learning it's probably one of the most satisfying and fun thing to do.

5 years later my brain can't accept looking at such a messy and ugly code.
